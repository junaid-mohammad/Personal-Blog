I'm Junaid, a third year computer engineering student at McGill and I have created this space to clear my mind while at the same time sharing my story with the world. The goal of this blog is to document my student and professional experiences, skills that I have developed, and lessons that I have learned.";

It is a fantastic personal exercise for anyone who needs a platform to just share their thoughts and connect with like-minded people. I plan on using this solely for that. This site was built using node and express hosted on render, and it stores user data in a mongodb database which is hosted on Atlas. I am only at the inital stages of this project. Stay tuned, there's a lot still to come!";
