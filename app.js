The goal of this blog is to document my student and professional experiences, skills that I have developed, and lessons that I have learned.";

It is a fantastic personal exercise for anyone who needs a platform to just share their thoughts and connect with like-minded people. I plan on using this solely for that. This site was built using node and express hosted on render, and it stores user data in a mongodb database which is hosted on Atlas. I am only at the inital stages of this project. Stay tuned, there's a lot still to come!";
