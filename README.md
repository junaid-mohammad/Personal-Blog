## üéØ Purpose

The **Personal Blog Project** was initially created during my second year at McGill to document my professional growth, extracurricular involvements, and side projects. Over time, I restructured and modernized the blog to improve its design, user experience, and functionality. The primary goals of this project were to:

- Practice **backend development** using **Node.js** and **Express**.
- Implement **EJS templating** to dynamically render pages with personalized content.
- Explore **MongoDB** for managing blog posts in a database.
- Enhance the blog's **front-end design** with **HTML/CSS**, including custom wave animations.
- Deploy the project on **Microsoft Azure App Service**.

Additionally, this project served as a way to reflect on my journey and personal growth while learning valuable web development skills.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Home Page with Dynamic Blog Posts**: The home page displays all blog posts stored in the **MongoDB database**. Each post is dynamically rendered using **EJS**.
- **Compose Page**: Users can create new blog posts through a user-friendly form. Posts are saved to the database and displayed on the home page.
- **Individual Blog Post Pages**: Each blog post has its own dedicated page with a unique URL, making it easy to share and reference specific entries.
- **About and Contact Pages**: Static pages to provide more context about the blog and a way for users to get in touch.
- **Contact Form with Thank-You Message**: A simple form to capture user messages, with a dynamic thank-you message displayed on the same page after submission.
- **Responsive Design**: The blog is fully responsive and works smoothly across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Custom Styling with Wave Animations**: The front-end design includes elegant wave animations and a modern color palette to enhance the user experience.

## üß© What I Learned

- **Dynamic Routing and Templating**: Practiced creating **dynamic routes** and **HTTP request handlers** with **Express**, along with **EJS templating** for personalized page rendering.
- **Database Management with MongoDB**: Gained experience in working with **MongoDB** for storing and retrieving data, including using **Mongoose** to define schemas and models.
- **Form Handling and Validation**: Learned to handle form submissions securely and dynamically render thank-you messages without redirecting to a new page.
- **Front-End Design Improvements**: Improved my front-end design skills by adding **wave animations**, **modern color schemes**, and **responsive layouts**.
- **Azure App Deployment**: Explored deploying a full-stack web app on **Microsoft Azure App Service**, managing configurations and environment variables for seamless deployment.

## üöÄ Deployment on Azure

The Personal Blog is deployed on **Microsoft Azure** using **App Service**. Below is a summary of the steps taken to deploy the project:

1. **Created an Azure Organization**: Set up a project in **Azure DevOps**.
2. **Pushed the Code to Azure Repos**: Used the following commands to add Azure as a remote repository and push the code:
   ```bash
   git remote add azure https://Junaid-Arif@dev.azure.com/Junaid-Arif/Personal%20Blog/_git/Personal%20Blog
   git push azure --all
   ```
3. **Configured App Service**:
   - Created a new **App Service** in Azure.
   - Linked the Azure Repo to the App Service for continuous deployment.
4. **Set Environment Variables**: Configured the app to use the correct port and MongoDB connection string:
   ```javascript
   const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
   mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI);
   ```
5. **Restarted the Service**: Restarted the Azure App Service to finalize the deployment.
